```

## Project Structure
- Each project within the folder ``prjs`` will have a structure similar to the following.
```
.                          # Project root.
├── resources              # Acquired information.
│   └── related_links.txt  # Related information.
└── src                    # Sources folder.
    └── index.js           # Entry point.
```
